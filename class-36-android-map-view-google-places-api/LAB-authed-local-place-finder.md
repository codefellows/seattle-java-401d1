## Feature Tasks
Create an app that loads a map view and allows users to pan around and zoomin
and out. Your app should persist it's own state so users alaways see where they
last left off.

Your app must have:
* A zoom in button
* A zoom out button
* A button to toggle through at least two different map view types
* A button that takes the user to one of your favorite places

## Documentation
In your `README.md` include screenshots of your app.

## Stretch Goals
* Allow users to click on a result and open the place in the native Google Maps
  app so they can get directions from there.
* Replace the default map icons with custom icons of your choice.
* Include some buttons in your app to show users your own pre-curated set of
  some of your favorite locations.
  * Ideas might include:
    * Your list of best places to get sandwiches in an area
    * Local spots tourists should see
    * Favorite music venues
    * Favorite bars
